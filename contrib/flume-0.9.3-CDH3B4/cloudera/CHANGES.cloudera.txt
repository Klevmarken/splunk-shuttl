    CLOUDERA-BUILD. CDH Mavenization for Flume.
    
    * When do-release-build is called, CDH Hadoop and Zookeeper jars are
      copied into the lib directory, while the checked-in equivalents are
      deleted. mvn install is called after Ant to get the jare into the
      local Maven repo, and, if appropriate, deployed to repository.cloudera.com.
