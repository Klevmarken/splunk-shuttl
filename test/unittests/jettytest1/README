This README helps you to run Shep functionality in a Jetty server on your host.
The splunk connector jar needs to be deployed to Jetty to run.
Also the jars in the jarlist file need to be copied to the jettydir/lib/ext dir.
Use the jetty.xml in this dir to run the jetty server.
Ensure that the port # of the S2SConnector is the same as the one in the outputs.conf of the shep app,
This is for the Phase I testing of Jetty-Shep Integration.
Run jetty as -
java -Dsplunk.home=<your splunk dir> -jar start.jar
